# Airnode-pm25-particle-prediction-

Different experiments related to pm25 particles prediction, based on different model.

Stream-lit app can be accessed from - 
Streamlit (deepesh-sherwal-surrey-airnode-surrey-new--app-g3fiuk.streamlit.app)

Primary Experiment on model - 
- Statistical model based experiments using ARIMA models (iTek-workshop.py)
- in BI-LSTM, we have tried to introduce EMD(Empirical mode decomposition) (emd-bilstm.ipynb)

Visualisation experiments - 
- Web view created using Stream-lit
- text prompts can be used to identify object within satellite maps (text_prompts.py)

--- Bibas work
it can be access as following - 
-Create a file Named Data and add another file named AQI.
-Download and Paste the CSV files from the "Data" folder inside AQI folder
-Run the dataX, Plot_AQI_dataY, Extract_combine in the given order.
-Run "model"
-Run the app1.py file through "streamlit run app1.py" commmand using the .pkl files (line 10) created by "model"
